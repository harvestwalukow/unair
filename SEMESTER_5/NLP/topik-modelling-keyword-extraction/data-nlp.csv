Prediction of a natural clay membrane selectivity towards heavy metal cations removal from wastewater: An electrochemical study,"Heavy metals such as cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), and copper (Cu) are among the most toxic environmental pollutants due to their non-biodegradability, high toxicity, and major health-related risks. This study presents the implementation of electrochemical approaches to predict the selectivity of clay membranes towards heavy metal cations and explore their suitability for efficient water filtration. The clay membranes are processed into carbon paste electrodes (CPEs) and used as platforms for electrochemical assessments to investigate their selectivity towards the filtration of heavy metal cations, using cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and linear sweep anodic stripping voltammetry (LSASV). CV showed that Clay-CPE5@1000 °C (5 wt.% of clay) demonstrated the highest peak current. Furthermore, the Nyquist plot for Clay-CPE5@1000 °C exhibited the highest conductivity and enhanced charge transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The selectivity of our proposed clay membrane followed the order of Pb2+ > Cu2+ > Hg2+ > Cd2+, according to the stripping currents in single-component systems. In a multi-component system, the Clay-CPE5@1000 °C electrode was found to be more selective towards Pb2+ and Cu2+ ions. Overall, these results proved the predictive capability of electrochemical approaches for heavy metal ion selectivity and demonstrated the potential of clay-based membranes for heavy metal cation filtration. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2023.",Ceramic membrane; Clay mineral; Electrochemical techniques; Filtration; Heavy metals

Optimizing photocatalytic dye degradation: A machine learning and metaheuristic approach for predicting methylene blue in contaminated water,"Dye contamination in water sources has severe environmental and public health issues; therefore, it needs effective monitoring and remediation strategies. The aim of the study is to use machine learning techniques to develop predictive models that may be used to evaluate methylene blue dye degradation capacity in contaminated water. Ten different machine learning models, including AdaBoost, Bagging, CatBoost, Decision Tree, Extra Trees, Gradient Boosting, HistGradientBoosting, LightGBM, Random Forest, and XGBoost, were evaluated using CuWO₄@TiO₂ as a photocatalyst. The evaluation metrics such as R², MSE, RMSE, MAE, and MedAE were used to assess the performance of the models. Among all models, HistGradientBoosting had a very well-balanced performance. It reached a very high R² of 0.9998 on the training set and 0.9915 on the test set, coupled with low error metrics, showcasing its strong generalization capability. However, Gradient Boosting and CatBoost exhibited impressive predictive performance, while AdaBoost and Decision Tree models suffered from overfitting. The maximum prediction obtained in the case of the integral approach for MB dye degradation is 98.99 %. Experimental validation indicated that the effectiveness under optimized conditions reached 98.5 %. In the case of initial MB concentration at 10 mg/L, a dosage of CuWO4@TiO2 photocatalyst at 200.33 mg/L, light intensity at 150 mW/cm², contact time at 88.6 min at room temperature, and near-neutral pH 7.0. The final model metrics included an R² score of 0.9915, MedAE of 1.171, MSE of 5.634, MAE of 1.735, and RMSE of 2.374. This work points out the possibility of taking complete advantage of advanced machine learning algorithms along with metaheuristics optimization in improving photocatalytic processes, hence opening a bright avenue for real applications in water treatment. © 2024 The Author(s)","Bayesian Optimization; HistGradientBoosting (HGB) model; Machine learning; Methylene Blue (MB), Dye degradation; Photocatalyst"
Hybrid Intelligent Technique between Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning to Predict Water Quality,"Water is the secret of life and occupies over 70% of the Earth’s surface. It has become necessary to protect the water resources around us from pollution and neglect, which can result in the loss of life and health. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to improve water quality analysis, forecasting, and monitoring systems for sustainable and environmentally friendly water resource management. As a result, this work focuses on the multi-model learning features to represent the state of the water and determine its suitability category (i.e., safe or unsafe). This is done by building a jointly hybrid model between supervised algorithms and unsupervised algorithms after fusing their outliers. In addition, the Gamel herd swarm optimization algorithm was applied to find the optimum hyperparameters.Two datasets were used, in the first dataset the proposed hybrid model outperformed other models by 99.2% in accuracy, AUC, and f1 score, but in the second dataset, it achieved approximately 92% in accuracy, AUC, and f1-score. Finally, the paper offered a methodology that researchers can use to anticipate water quality using hybrid machine learning. © 2025 University of Bahrain.

Advanced machine vision techniques for groundwater level prediction modeling geospatial and statistical research,"This study utilizes three models, namely Weight of Evidence (WOE), Frequency Ratio (FR), and Index of Vulnerability (IV), to identify groundwater potential zones (GWPZ) in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Nowshera District, Pakistan. We incorporated a total of twelve variables, encompassing elevation, slope, distance to the rivers, rainfall, curvature, drainage density, land use/land cover, topographic wetness index, height above the nearest drainage, NDVI, distance to the roads, and soil type, utilizing ArcGIS 10.8. The AUROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic) assessed the dependability of the models. GWPZ was categorized into five classifications: very low, low, moderate, high, and very high. The WOE model produced distributions of 10.14 % (262.09 km2), 19.58 % (506.00 km2), 26.75 % (691.10 km2), 27.10 % (700.18 km2), and 16.40 % (423.75 km2) respectively. The FR yielded 20.93 % (538.90 km2), 32.38 % (833.53 km2), 18.92 % (487.14 km2), 13.13 % (337.94 km2), and 14.61 % (376.07 km2). The IV model resulted in 14.41 % (372.46 km2), 17.17 % (443.67 km2), 29.01 % (749.52 km2), 25.85 % (667.97 km2), and 13.53 % (349.50 km2). The AUC-ROC for WOE, FR, and IV were 58.06%, 87.53%, and 84.98%, respectively. All models accurately defined the GWPZ, with the FR approach demonstrating notable potential. These findings provide vital information for managing groundwater resources and the design of metropolitan areas. Our developed methodology can be used in places with comparable characteristics. It is a valuable tool for policymakers interested in sustainable groundwater management. © 2024 COSPAR",Comparative Statistical Modeling; Earth observation techniques; Groundwater potential zones; Machine vision; Multi-Spectral satellite imagery; ROC Curve Analysis
Hybrid Modeling of Deep Neural Networks and Ordinary Logistic Regression for Predicting Groundwater Quality,"Groundwater quality plays a crucial role in daily life and public health, particularly in regions that rely on groundwater resources for domestic, agricultural, and industrial needs. Predictive modeling of groundwater quality is essential for managing and protecting water resources sustainably. This study proposes a hybrid approach combining deep neural networks (DNNs) and ordinary logistic regression (OLR) to enhance the accuracy of groundwater quality predictions. This hybrid approach leverages the capability of DNNs to capture complex non-linear patterns, while OLR is utilized for simpler and more structured coefficient interpretation of factors influencing water quality. The data used in the study includes various environmental and hydrogeological variables affecting groundwater quality, such as pH, heavy metal content, and other minerals. The results indicate that the hybrid DNN-OLR model achieves higher predictive accuracy, at 92.23%, compared to using DNN or OLR individually, which yield accuracies of 58.80%. The integration of these two methods also offers advantages in result interpretation, with OLR providing more transparent insights into the influence of independent variables, while DNN delivers stronger predictive capabilities through non-linear data processing. Therefore, this hybrid model has the potential to be applied for real-time groundwater quality monitoring and as a decision-support tool in water resource management. © 2025 The authors.

"Geospatial Mapping of River Health Assessment: A Study Case of Spatial and Seasonal Monitoring at Sumbawa Island Watersheds, Indonesia","River water is a vital resource for human use and economic growth, but pollution from anthropogenic activities can significantly diminish its quality. Consequently, regular monitoring is essential for river water conservation. This chapter outlines a river health assessment comprising three stages: (1) developing the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model for the selection of monitoring sites, (2) mapping river health with the Storage and Retrieval (STORET) index using Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) interpolation, and (3) conducting multivariate analysis to identify pollution sources. The study focused on watersheds in the Bima, Dompu, and Sumbawa districts, on Sumbawa Island (Indonesia). In the initial stage, the SWAT identified observation stations and predicted the conditions of water quality ranged from excellent to moderately polluted. In the subsequent stage, in situ analysis revealed that dissolved nutrient levels in the Bima and Dompu districts exceeded 0.5 mg/L, while total dissolved solids (TDS) in the Sumbawa district surpassed 1,000 mg/L, particularly in downstream areas. Meanwhile, the last stage revealed that excellent river health was found in forest areas on slopes exceeding 25°, whereas decreased health was observed in agricultural and urban areas on gentle slopes, particularly near coastal regions. Analysis of water quality variables indicated that phosphate, TDS, and ammonia concentrations were higher in urban and agricultural watersheds, whereas forested areas showed better river health with higher dissolved oxygen levels. These stages may serve as a comprehensive methodology for riverine monitoring for water resource conservation policies. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.",Environmental monitoring; Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW); Multivariate; River Health; Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT); Storage and Retrieval Index (STORET Index); Water Quality Index
Micro-Nanoplastics Pollution and Its Oxidative Stress-Induced Effects on Fish Physiology in Coastal Waters of Surabaya,"This study investigates the impact of micro-nanoplastics (MNPs) as water pollutants on the East Coast of Surabaya, Indonesia, and examines their biochemical effects on the blood serum of exposed fish. The physiological condition of fish serves as a bioindicator of environmental quality. The objective of this research was to assess the enzymatic biochemical responses of eight fish species (86 specimens in total) commonly caught by local fishermen. Observed parameters include species identification, MNP distribution and particle size in seawater and fish tissues (gastrointestinal tract, liver, and muscle), as well as biochemical markers indicating oxidative stress, immune response, and apoptosis.The identified fish species include Mugil cephalus, Johnius trachycephalus, Plotosus canius, Harpadon nehereus (H. sagor), Sillago verrucosa, Dasyatis sp., Megalops nigriceps, and Galeocerdo cuvier. Micro-nanoplastics were detected in seawater and within fish tissues, with varying distribution and particle sizes across different organs. Histopathological analysis revealed MNP adhesion on gill lamellae surfaces and lesions in intestinal villi. Biochemical assays showed malondialdehyde (MDA) levels ranging from 2.24 to 4.30 nmol/mL, while superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels ranged from 13.83 to 24.75 ng/mL. The highest levels of interleukin-12 (IL-12), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) were observed in S. verrucosa, Dasyatis sp., and G. cuvier, respectively. Additionally, elevated levels of Caspase-9 and Caspase-3 indicated increased pro-apoptotic activity. These findings confirm that MNP contamination is present in the waters of the East Coast of Surabaya and has bioaccumulated in fish tissues. The accumulation induces physiological disturbances mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS), as reflected in elevated oxidative stress markers, altered immune cytokine expression, and increased apoptosis, ultimately affecting the health, vitality, and survival of the fish. © 2025 by the authors.",Aquatic; Fisheries; Marine; Microplastics; pollution
